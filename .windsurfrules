This is an application for conducting surveys based on the AI chat.

The functionality of the application is divided into two parts:
1. The part where a survey is conducted, it's a simple chat window that is supposed to collect and save answers tot he survey
2. A survey creation page where we set up the questions and describe what kind of answers we expect.

For conveniance, let's use local storage to store the answers and questions.
Use shadcn-vue for ui, style additionally with tailwind if needed.
Use firebase for authentication (vue-firstore for Nuxt 3).
