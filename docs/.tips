# Tips for Working with the Codebase

## Firebase Data Structure
1. Always check the actual data structure in Firebase before implementing queries
2. Don't assume fields exist - make them optional in interfaces if they're not guaranteed
3. Keep queries simple - start with getting all data before adding filters
4. Use console.log to track data flow through the application

## Code Organization
1. Keep business logic in services
2. Use composables for shared functionality
3. Handle loading and error states in components
4. Follow existing naming conventions

## Best Practices
1. Add proper TypeScript interfaces that match the actual data
2. Include loading states for better UX
3. Add error handling at all levels
4. Use console.log strategically for debugging
5. Test with real data before implementing complex filters
